With the exception of the MIDI input and rotational controls, all supporting
circuits are provided by the Professional Development Board. The schematic may
be downloaded from http://www.parallax.com.

Power supply with 3.3v and 5v.

Parallax Propeller:
5 MHz crystal
Prop Plug or equivalent circuit on P30 and P31
Reset button
24LC256 EEPROM

VGA output:
5x 270ohm resistor
3x 560ohm resistor
3x 130ohm resistor
1x VGA connector

MIDI:
1x 1N914 diode
1x 220ohm resistor
1x 180ohm resistor
1x PC900V optical isolator
1x 5pin DIN female

Flash Storage:
1x W25Q32FV 

Audio Output:
1x 10K resistor
1x 10nF capacitor
1x 1uF capacitor

Controls:
3x 2 bit gray code rotational encoding knobs
6x 10K resistor

The audio, VGA and Propeller supporting circuits are all quite well
documented by Parallax.

The flash storage is a subsection of the Propeller Memory Card, specifically
the W25Q32FV.

Flash connections:
memory:     propeller:
IHOLD/IO3   P3
ICS         P5
DO/IO1      P1
CLK         P7
DI/IO0      P0
IWP/IO2     P2

Audio:
Audio circuit is connected to P9. A significant amount of noise could probably
be removed by buffering the output using a comparator and high value bypass
capacitor on its power supply input.

VGA:
VGA circuit is connected P16-P23:
P16:        V
P17:        H
P18:        B0
P19:        B1
P20:        G0
P21:        G1
P22:        R0
P23:        R1

MIDI:
MIDI circuit is as described by the MIDI electrical specification (available
from http://www.midi.org). For 3.3v operation, the open collector of the
optical isolator is pulled high to 3.3v using a 180ohm resistor (in place
of the 280ohm 5V circuit). The PC900V itself still must be powered with 5v.

If you search Google for quick MIDI interface circuits, you may find some
simply using a resistor from the device's output directly into the input port
of the microcontroller. DO NOT DO THIS! The Propeller is not 5v tolerant if
the device is using a 5v current loop, and it blows the design point of MIDI.
The device is expecting an isolated current loop and is making no guarantees
as to its output voltage. Further, the optical isolator is used for a reason
to avoid current loops.

Control circuit:
The inputs to the Propeller (and thus output from the switches) are pulled
high to 3.3v using 10k resistors. Closing the switch should pull the selected
outputs low to ground.

P10-P15 are used for the switch inputs. P10-11 is fine control, P12-13 is
coarse control, P14-15 is menu selection.
